#STORAGE Services
This Service collects all kind of necessary data from database service and external adapter services. While it uses SOAP technologies with data base service, it is using REST technologies with external services. Communication between them is made by JSON messages. This service sends the data to Business-Logic and Process-Centric layers by using SOAP technology.
